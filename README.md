# Seattle-AirBnB-Analysis

Introduction I recently visited Seattle with a number of good friends and had nothing but positive comments about the city. I grew up in the San Francisco/Bay Area all my life and when I stepped foot in Seattle I saw it as a fresh start with exciting new opportunities. In this notebook I will be taking my first step into data science so what better data to explore than with the city that started my curiosity into tech.

I have three questions I want to answer with this dataset.

Where are the most expensive neighbourhoods to rent an AirBnB?
How are property types dispersed throughout Seattle?
Are there areas of potential opportunities depending on neighbourhoods?
I will try to keep this as informative as possible for other beginner data scientists and programers like myself and will include YouTube tutorials I looked at to aid in this project.
